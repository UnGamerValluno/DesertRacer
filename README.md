# DesertRacer

Basic 2D game made following the [Unreal Engine 2D Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-2d) from [GameDevTV](https://www.gamedev.tv/)

## Main Level
The base game includes the development of a simple 2D race track using two type of sprites to create an obstacle course

## Best Time
This kind of game seemed perfect for a best score kind of mechanic so I applied what I implemented in the [Simple Shooter](https://github.com/UnGamerValluno/SimpleShooter)
and added a widget to keep track of the current time and the best time during the current playtime

## New Best Time
Additionaly, I felt it was important for the player to be aware when a new best time has been
achieved so I implemented an animation to change the color and visibility of the best time
labels so it can get the player's attention and produce a rewrding feeling.

## Speed Boost Power Up
Finally, I added a speed boost power up, just to spice things up. Here is how it looks on the track

Once the player steps into it, the power up will be activated granting 2X speed for 2 seconds. Also a burst of flames
will come out of the car and a neat propulsion sound will play
