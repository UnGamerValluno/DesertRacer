# DesertRacer

Basic 2D game made following the [Unreal Engine 2D Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-2d) from [GameDevTV](https://www.gamedev.tv/)

## Main Level
The base game includes the development of a simple 2D race track using two type of sprites to create an obstacle course

## Best Time
This kind of game seemed perfect for a best score kind of mechanic so I applied what I implemented in the [Simple Shooter](https://github.com/UnGamerValluno/SimpleShooter)
and added a widget to keep track of the current time and the best time during the current playtime

## New Best Time
Additionaly, I felt it was important for the player to be aware when a new best time has been
achieved so I implemented an animation to change the color and visibility of the best time
labels so it can get the player's attention and produce a rewrding feeling.
